# Samplify
The first version of my application, Samplify. THe new project is currently being developed using the JUCE library (C++) instead of C#.

This version uses WPF and XAML for UI design. This already had issues as multithreading in C# is a much more difficult process, so going to C++ was the next step.

All work on this repository was translated and expanded upon in the C++ version.
